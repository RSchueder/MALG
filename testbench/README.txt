README - Testbenches

broch -> 
1DV 10 segment model for Broch paper reproduction

col -> 
A10 layer 90 segment model 
first model used to test the code
abandoned after broch model
col-hyd contains the hydrodynamics

tidal_flume_farm ->
a dummy 3D model with tidal variation used to test the allocation of biomass 
in a sigmalayer model with tidal variation in waterlevel
	farm3D          = hydro, although it was run on the p drive and then copied outside this directory due to size limitations
	farm3DWQ        = test case for high biomass
	Farm3DWQ_1frond = test case for a single frond (should be close to broch)
	farm3DWQ_NZB    = biomass settings set to what is known about NZB
